**Describtion:**
The game begins with a demonstration of a set of cards. They lie "face down". When you click on any one, a number opens for a few seconds. 
The player's task is find all cards with the same numbers. If you turn over the second card after opening the first one and the numbers match, both cards disappear from the field. If they don't match, the cards are closed again. The task is open all of them.  __*Click on the [link](https://zhenshenzarukina.github.io/game-find-a-couple/) to play.*__
